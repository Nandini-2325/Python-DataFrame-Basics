# Python-DataFrame-Basics
# üöó Pandas Vehicle Dataset Analysis  

This repository contains exercises using **Pandas** to explore and analyze a vehicle dataset (`mpg.csv`). The goal is to practice **data exploration, Boolean operations, arithmetic calculations, and column manipulation** in Python.  

---

## üìå Summary of Tasks

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Imported the CSV dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Explored the data using `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.describe()`, `.shape()`, `.mean()`, `.sum()`, `.value_counts()`, `.max()`, `.min()`, `len()`, and `.median()`.
   - Sorted values to inspect specific columns.

2. **Creating New Columns**
   - Created a Boolean column `is_automatic` indicating if a vehicle has an automatic transmission.
   - Added a calculated column `fuel_economy` as a **weighted average**:  
     `fuel_economy = (city_mpg * 0.55) + (highway_mpg * 0.45)`.

3. **Analysis Using Boolean Masking**
   - Used `is_automatic` to **count the number of automatic vehicles**.
   - Determined **percentage of subcompact vehicles**.
   - Filtered vehicles with `fuel_economy` **above the median** using Boolean masking.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Importing the CSV and Exploring the Dataset

import pandas as pd

### Load the dataset
mpg = pd.read_csv('mpg.csv')

### Display first few rows
mpg.head()

**Task:** Use the `is_automatic` column to find how many vehicles are automatic.  

### Sum the Boolean column to count automatic vehicles
mpg['is_automatic'].sum()

**Task:** Determine what percentage of vehicles are subcompacts.

### Count subcompact vehicles and calculate percentage
subcompact_percentage = mpg[mpg["class"] == "subcompact"]["class"].count() / len(mpg) * 100

**Task:** Add a `fuel_economy` column as a weighted average of city and highway MPG (55% city, 45% highway).

### Calculate weighted fuel economy
mpg['fuel_economy'] = mpg['cty'] * 0.55 + mpg['hwy'] * 0.45

### Display first few rows to verify
mpg.head()
<img width="1222" height="197" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83ffda13-b1ae-4f10-8d12-508d6192054f" />

**Task:** Use Boolean masking to find vehicles with `fuel_economy` above the median.

### Filter vehicles with fuel_economy above the median
high_fe_vehicles = mpg[mpg.fuel_economy > mpg.fuel_economy.median()]

### Display first few rows
high_fe_vehicles.head()
